A note in terms of localization: Sushiish is a take away shop located in Oslo, Norway. Because of this, the default field for country is set to Norway and the phone number pattern/validation is a 8-digit number. In terms of currency being used in this app, American dollars ($) is used to make it easier for readers of this project to understand the price point in stead of Norwegian kroner.

* There are two main navigations in the app:
    * **Index navigation**: This is the navigation for the landing page where users can use the links to quick jump to different sections of the landing page: **About, Catering, Contact, Account, and Menu (online shop)**.
